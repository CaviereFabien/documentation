The Atlas of Living Australia is building infrastructure and tools to enable researchers and other users of biodiversity information to find, access and combine and visualise data on Australian plants and animals.

This wiki documents the components of the Atlas of Living Australia that are progressively being used outside of the ALA team and becoming an open project.  This is an open wiki, intended to capture the technical documentation about the components necessary for adopters to understand, install, configure, customize and operate the tools.  

This is an open project, and users are encouraged to get involved - please [use the mailing list](http://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/ala-portal) to request access to edit this wiki or ask any questions.

#### Principles ####
1. We maintain documentation mainly by using the wiki. To clone the wiki repo, you do:

        $ git clone https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation.wiki.git

2. We for now deliberately keep the documentation project itself empty and only use the wiki part for documentation. This means we don't work on the https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation.git repo but https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/documentation.wiki.git.

If you happened to any problems, or have any questions and suggestions, please feel free to file an issue here. Thanks!
